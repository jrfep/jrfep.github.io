abstract = {—We developed a field survey protocol based on the North American Breeding Bird Survey to evaluate the efficiency and reliability of a bird monitoring scheme in the Neotropics, known as NeoMaps. A team of 21 amateur and professional ornithologists conducted bird counts at 27 locations distributed throughout Venezuela between March and April 2010. Locations selected followed a stratified spatial sampling design derived from environmental and biogeographical variables. Two complementary survey protocols were implemented in consecutive days along 40-km- long roadside transects. Three-minute point counts were performed at 50 stops, 800 m from each other on day 1. Cumulative species lists were recorded at a selection of 10 stops sampled for 9 min each, divided into three consecutive 3- min periods on day 2. We recorded 593 species at the 27 sites combined, representing 57{\%}of the 1,033 potential species, or 43{\%}of all known Venezuelan species. An additional 83 species were recorded outside of the formal point counts, for a total of 676 species detected. Groups such as hummingbirds and most waterbirds had unusually low numbers of both species and individuals, probably due to an abnormally dry year. Our survey methods appear to be appropriate for surveying most common diurnal non-colonial species. This is the first large-scale, systematic bird survey in Venezuela or, to our knowledge, in any other tropical country.},

abstract = {Sampling optimization for tropical invertebrates: An example using dung beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeinae) in Venezuela. The development of efficient sampling protocols is an essential prerequisite to evaluate and identify priority conservation areas. There are few protocols for fauna inventory and monitoring in wide geographical scales for the tropics, where the complexity of communities and high biodiversity levels, make the implementation of efficient protocols more difficult. We proposed here a simple strategy to optimize the capture of dung beetles, applied to sampling with baited traps and generalizable to other sampling methods. We analyzed data from eight transects sampled between 2006-2008 with the aim to develop an uniform sampling design, that allows to confidently estimate species richness, abundance and composition at wide geographical scales. We examined four characteristics of any sampling design that affect the effectiveness of the sampling effort: the number of traps, sampling duration, type and proportion of bait, and spatial arrangement of the traps along transects. We used species accumulation curves, rank-abundance plots, indicator species analysis, and multivariate correlograms. We captured 40 337 individuals (115 species/morphospecies of 23 genera). Most species were attracted by both dung and carrion, but two thirds had greater relative abundance in traps baited with human dung. Different aspects of the sampling design influenced each diversity attribute in different ways. To obtain reliable richness estimates, the number of traps was the most important aspect. Accurate abundance estimates were obtained when the sampling period was increased, while the spatial arrangement of traps was determinant to capture the species composition pattern. An optimum sampling strategy for accurate estimates of richness, abundance and diversity should: (1) set 50-70 traps to maximize the number of species detected, (2) get samples during 48-72 hours and set trap groups along the transect to reliably estimate species abundance, (3) set traps in groups of at least 10 traps to suitably record the local species composition, and (4) separate trap groups by a distance greater than 5-10km to avoid spatial autocorrelation. For the evaluation of other sampling protocols we recommend to, first, identify the elements of sampling design that could affect the sampled effort (the number of traps, sampling duration, type and proportion of bait) and their spatial distribution (spatial arrangement of the traps) and then, to evaluate how they affect richness, abundance and species composition estimates.},

abstract = {We aggregated data on butterfly-host plant associations from existing sources in order to address the following questions: (1) is there a general correlation between host diversity and butterfly species richness?, (2) has the evolution of host plant use followed consistent patterns across butterfly lineages?, (3) what is the common ancestral host plant for all butterfly lineages? The compilation included 44,148 records from 5,152 butterfly species (28.6{\%} of worldwide species of Papilionoidea) and 1,193 genera (66.3{\%}). The overwhelming majority of butterflies use angiosperms as host plants. Fabales is used by most species (1,007 spp.) from all seven butterfly families and most subfamilies, Poales is the second most frequently used order, but is mostly restricted to two species-rich subfamilies: Hesperiinae (56.5{\%} of all Hesperiidae), and Satyrinae (42.6{\%} of all Nymphalidae). We found a significant and strong correlation between host plant diversity and butterfly species richness. A global test for congruence (Parafit test) was sensitive to uncertainty in the butterfly cladogram, and suggests a mixed system with congruent associations between Papilionidae and magnoliids, Hesperiidae and monocots, and the remaining subfamilies with the eudicots (fabids and malvids), but also numerous random associations. The congruent associations are also recovered as the most probable ancestral states in each node using maximum likelihood methods. The shift from basal groups to eudicots appears to be more likely than the other way around, with the only exception being a Satyrine-clade within the Nymphalidae that feed on monocots. Our analysis contributes to the visualization of the complex pattern of interactions at superfamily level and provides a context to discuss the timing of changes in host plant utilization that might have promoted diversification in some butterfly lineages.},

Location Venezuela. Methods We placed a grid over Venezuela (0.5-{\'{a}}+{\`{u}}-{\'{a}}0.5 degree cells) and applied a stratified sampling design to select a minimum set of 25 cells spanning environmental and biogeographical variation. We implemented standardized field sampling protocols for birds, butterflies and dung beetles, along transects on environmental gradients (G{\c{C}}{\"{y}}gradsectsG{\c{C}}{\"{O}}). We compared species richness estimates from our field surveys at national, bioregional and cell scales to those calculated from data compiled from museum collections and the literature. We estimated the variance in richness, composition, relative abundance and diversity between gradsects that could be explained by environmental and biogeographical variables. We also estimated total survey effort and cost. Results In one field season, we covered 8{\%} of the country and recorded 66{\%} of all known Venezuelan dung beetles, 52{\%} of Pierid butterflies and 37{\%} of birds. Environmental variables explained 27G{\c{C}}{\^{o}}60{\%} of variation in richness for all groups and 13G{\c{C}}{\^{o}}43{\%} of variation in abundance and diversity in dung beetles and birds. Bioregional and environmental variables explained 43G{\c{C}}{\^{o}}58{\%} of the variation in the dissimilarity matrix between transects for all groups. Main conclusions NeoMaps provides reliable estimates of richness, composition and relative abundance, required for rigorous monitoring and spatial prediction. NeoMaps requires a substantial investment, but is highly efficient, achieving survey goals for each group with 1-month fieldwork and about US{\$} 1G{\c{C}}{\^{o}}8 per km2. Future work should focus on other advantages of this type of survey, including the ability to monitor the changes in relative abundance and turnover in species composition, and thus overall diversity patterns},

abstract = {Ecological traps occur when rapid environmental change makes organisms' habitat selection cues misleading and leads them to prefer poor quality habitats. Such traps can threaten the persistence of affected populations, so techniques to predict and map potential traps are ofgreat conservation interest. Here we present a novel method for visualizing such traps and their uncertainty at large scales in a natural landscape, by combining a spatially explicit model of anthropogenic threats with one of occurrence probability. We began with poaching and occur- rence data for Andean bears in the Cordillera de M{\'{e}}rida, Venezuela, and applied a partitioning procedure to generate 10 replicates of three partially independent data subsets. To the first subset, we fit a previously developed model of poaching probability, while we used the second and third subsets to fit, validate and select the best offour occurrence probability models. We then combined replicates ofthe poaching probability model with those ofthe best occurrence probability model to predict the spatial distribution and uncertainty of potential ecological traps. The best occurrence model predicted high probabilities in the center and in the north- ern parts of Cordillera de M{\'{e}}rida, with variation among replicates in the same areas. Predicted areas ofoccurrence covered 10 217 ± 2762 km2 (24{\%}) of the study area. However, more than a third of this area had a high probability of being an ecological trap. Furthermore, these potential ecological traps were next to or within the largest national parks and were surrounded by large areas with high occurrence probability and low poaching probability. Future research should focus on independent verification of potential occupancy and ecological traps, as well as on bear dispersal behavior. In areas where ecological traps are confirmed, targeted education and law enforcement will be most effective, while in confirmed safe harbor areas, increasing connectivity will be equally important. Our approach will be useful to identify potential ecological traps at the landscape level created by hunting and other human activities elsewhere in the world.},

abstract = {Documenting changes in distribution is necessary for understanding species' response to environmental changes, but data on species distributions are heterogeneous in accuracy and resolution. Combining different data sources and methodological approaches can fill gaps in knowledge about the dynamic processes driving changes in species-rich, but data-poor regions. We combined recent bird survey data from the Neotropical Biodiversity Mapping Initiative (NeoMaps) with historical distribution records to estimate potential changes in the distribution of eight species of Amazon parrots in Venezuela. Using environmental covariates and presence-only data from museum collections and the literature, we first used maximum likelihood to fit a species distribution model (SDM) estimating a historical maximum probability of occurrence for each species. We then used recent, NeoMaps survey data to build single-season occupancy models (OM) with the same environmental covariates, as well as with time- and effort-dependent detectability, resulting in estimates of the current probability of occurrence. We finally calculated the disagreement between predictions as a matrix of probability of change in the state of occurrence. Our results suggested negative changes for the only restricted, threatened species, Amazona barbadensis, which has been independently confirmed with field studies. Two of the three remaining widespread species that were detected, Amazona amazonica, Amazona ochrocephala, also had a high probability of negative changes in northern Venezuela, but results were not conclusive for Amazona farinosa. The four remaining species were undetected in recent field surveys; three of these were most probably absent from the survey locations (Amazona autumnalis, Amazona mercenaria and Amazona festiva), while a fourth (Amazona dufresniana) requires more intensive targeted sampling to estimate its current status. Our approach is unique in taking full advantage of available, but limited data, and in detecting a high probability of change even for rare and patchily-distributed species. However, it is presently limited to species meeting the strong assumptions required for maximum-likelihood estimation with presence-only data, including very high detectability and representative sampling of its historical distribution. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {? 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.A good indicator species should be easy to sample, identify and measure, and be informative about its ecological context. We analysed data from a nation-wide dung beetle survey in Venezuela in order to assess the indicative response of Oxysternon festivum (Coleoptera: Scarabaeinae) to vegetation and climatic condition in the Orinoco river basin. Our approach consisted of two steps: estimating habitat suitability (HS) from historical records and mean environmental conditions, and analysing four different properties measured during a nationwide survey (occurrence, total abundance, individual body size, and total biomass), in relationship with HS and current environmental covariates measured from remote sensors. O. festivum population status could not be completely explained by historical or current conditions alone, but rather by combinations of both. It was strongly associated with forest vegetation, but abundance, biomass and body size increased under harsher (hotter and drier) climatic conditions. Thus, O. festivum seems to be sensitive to changes in vegetation cover, but tolerant to certain levels of perturbance, where it probably replaces other, more sensitive species. Fully understanding the role of O. festivum requires the analysis of its relationships to other species. We strongly recommend the development of similar protocols for the analysis of other potential ecological indicator species, drawing information from historical and contemporary sources and exploiting the available statistical tools to reveal complex patterns. Given the high diversity of dung beetles, and the growing interest in this group, several candidates will probably be found in most tropical countries.},

abstract = {? 2016 Elsevier Ltd.Kalanchoe daigremontiana and Stapelia gigantea are two succulent invasive species with potential impacts on recruitment of native vegetation in a protected area of importance for conservation of arid environments in northern South America. We hypothesized that while K. daigremontiana has the potential for inhibiting recruitment of native plants through allelopathic effects, S. gigantea could facilitate recruitment of nurse-dependent native taxa. To explore these contrasting impacts, we designed a comparative study and a transplant experiment. Density of native seedlings and species richness were significantly lower in patches invaded by K. daigremontiana when compared to patches with native vegetation or invaded by S. gigantea, suggesting that native-seedling recruitment is negatively affected by K. daigremontiana and not affected or facilitated by S. gigantea. The experiment did not generate results concordant with those obtained in the comparative study. Seedlings' recruitment of two selected native species was facilitated by presence of nurse-plants (exotics and natives); however, the magnitude of this effect varied according to the type of nurse-plant, susceptibility to herbivory, and herbivory level. We identify K. daigremontiana as the invasive with top need for management actions, because it has the potential to alter composition and physiognomy of native-plant communities in tropical arid environments.},

However, our understanding of the mechanisms behind these declines is insufficient to predict the timing and loca- tion of local extinctions.We collected data on presence/absence and time since extirpation of jaguars across Venezuela. To test if human impacts or ecosystemproductivity better explain the observed spatial variation in probability of jaguar occurrence we compared logistic regressionmodels fit with different combinations of anthropogenic and environmental variables. Similarly, we modelled the time since extirpation, using a multiple regression approach. Our study supported the hypothesis that jaguar extirpations and distribution are determined by a joint effect of anthropogenic factors and environmental variables,mainly those related with ecosystem productivity. Human population density and habitat alterations exerted strong negative ef- fects on jaguar populations,while annual precipitation, mean temperature, forest cover, primary productiv- ity, and other vegetation indices had positive effects. The strength of human impact is shaped by ecosystem productivity: jaguars disappear faster in dry, unproductive areas, and survive better in humid, productive areas evenwhen human densities are higher.We estimated that jaguars in Venezuela have been extirpated fromapproximately 26{\%} of the territory of Venezuela; present jaguar range covers approximately 66{\%} of the country.We demonstrate that human population density alone cannot adequately explain past extirpations nor predict future jaguar declines.We conclude that the predicted future growth of the human population will not necessarily determine jaguar declines, and proper management and conservation programs could potentially prevent jaguar extirpations. {\textcopyright}},

We aimed to estimate: (1) the Red Siskin's historic distribution in Venezuela; (2) the portion of this historic distribution lost to vegetation degradation; and (3) the location of key habitats or areas with both, a high probability of historic occurrence and a low probability of vegetation degradation. We ground-truthed 191 locations and used expert opinion as well as landscape characteristics to classify species' habitat suitability as excellent, good, acceptable, or poor. We fit a Random Forest model (RF) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) time series to evaluate the accuracy and precision of the expert categorization of habitat suitability. We estimated the probability of historic occurrence by fitting a MaxLike model using 88 presence records (1960–2013) and data on forest cover and aridity index. Of the entire study area, 23{\%} (20,696 km 2 ) had a historic probability of Red Siskin occurrence over 0.743. Furthermore, 85{\%} of ground-truthed locations had substantial reductions in mean EVI, resulting in key habitats totaling just 976 km 2 , in small blocks in the western and central regions. Decline in Area of Occupancy over 15 years was between 40{\%} and 95{\%}, corresponding to an extinction risk category between Vulnerable and Critically Endangered. Relating key habitats with other landscape features revealed significant risks and opportunities for proposed conservation interventions, including the fact that ongoing vegetation degradation could limit the establishment of reintroduced populations in eastern areas, while the conservation of remaining key habitats on private lands could be improved with biodiversity-friendly agri- and silviculture programs.},

abstract = {It has long been recognized that plant invasions may alter carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycles, but the direction and magnitude of such alterations have been rarely quantified. In this study, we quantified the effects caused by the invasion of a noxious exotic plant, Kalanchoe daigremontiana (Crassulaceae), on C and N mineralization and enzymatic and microbial activities in the soil of a semiarid locality in Venezuela. We compared soil parameters associated with these processes (C and N mineralization time and the cumulative values, fluorescein diacetate hydrolytic activity, and activities of dehydrogenase, $\beta$-glucosidase, glucosaminidase, and urease) between invaded and adjacent non-invaded sites. In addition, correlations among these parameters and the soil physical-chemical properties were also examined to determine if a positive feedback exists between nutrient availability and K. daigremontiana invasion. Overall, our results showed that C mineralization and transformation of organic compounds to NH4+were favored at sites colonized by K. daigremontiana. With this species, we found the highest cumulative amounts of NH4+-N and C and the lowest mineralization time. These results could be explained by higher activities of urease and glucosaminidase in soils under the influence of K. daigremontiana. In addition, higher amounts of organic matter and moisture content in invaded soils might favor C and N mineralization. In conclusion, invasion of Neotropical semiarid zones by K. daigremontiana may influence the chemical and biological properties of the soils covered by this species, increasing nutrient bioavailability, which, in time, can facilitate the invasion process.},

@article{Sanchez-Mercado2008,
abstract = {Worldwide, many large mammals are threatened by poaching. However, understanding the causes of poaching is difficult when both hunter and hunted are elusive. One alternative is to apply regression models to opportunistically-collected data but doing so without accounting for inherent biases may result in misleading conclusions. To demonstrate a straightforward method to account for such biases, and to guide further research on an elusive Vulnerable species, we visualized spatio-temporal poaching patterns in 844 Andean bear Tremarctos ornatus presence reports from the Cordillera de M{\&}{\#}233;rida, Venezuela. To create maps of poaching risk we fitted two logistic regression models to a subset of 287 precisely georeferenced reports, one ignoring and one including spatial autocorrelation. Whereas the variance explained by both models was low, the second had better fit and predictive ability, and indicated that protected status had a significant positive effect on reducing poaching risk. Poaching risk increased at lower altitudes, where all indicators of human disturbance increased, although there was scant evidence that human-bear conflicts are a major direct trigger of poaching events. Because highest-risk areas were different from areas with most bear reports, we speculate that hunting may be driven by opportunistic encounters, rather than by purposeful searches in high-quality bear habitat. Further research comparing risk maps with bear abundance models and data on poaching behaviour will be invaluable for clarifying poaching causes and for identifying management strategies.},
