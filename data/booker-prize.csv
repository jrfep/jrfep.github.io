*In 1969 and 1970 the prize was awarded to a novel published in the year previous to that in which the prize was given. In 1971 the prize was awarded to a novel published that same year, between January and November. Because the rule change precluded eligibility for novels published in 1970, the one-off Lost Man Booker Prize was devised in 2010 to honour such a novel. The winner, decided by public vote, was Troubles by J.G. Farrell.
