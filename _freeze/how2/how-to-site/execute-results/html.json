I know it is confusing, but this is how I work. If you require clarifications please open an issue or send me a message. \n\nAll files are available in a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/jrfep/jrfep.github.io).  The `mostly-harmless` branch uses [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/) to build the site.\n\n\n## Libraries\n\nTo manage and update the version of libraries that we need, I used `renv` for some iterations, but it was complex to keep version across machines and different OSs...\n\nWhen we use `renv` we need to run different commands, until all the changes have been synchronised[^1] :\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrenv::init()\nrenv::status()\nrenv::install()\nrenv::status()\nrenv::snapshot()\n```\n:::\n\n\nBut if we don't update the .gitignore file things can get messy.\n\n## Render site\n\nWith Rmarkdown we could run this (in RStudio) to render site locally:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrmarkdown::render_site()\n```\n:::\n\n\nOr preview one file\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrmarkdown::render_site(\"presentations.Rmd\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nWith quarto and RStudio we can open the Build tab and select Build Website...\n\nOr we can go to the command line and render the site: \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.sh .cell-code}\nquarto render \n```\n:::\n\n\nSing [All the rowboats](https://youtu.be/2CZ8ossU4pc) in the meantime (optional).\n\nAnd then launch a preview:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.sh .cell-code}\nquarto preview\n```\n:::\n\n\nIf this work, we can just `git add`, `git commit` and `git push` it to the repo and see the changes!\n\n## Alternatives\n\nMy [other branch](https://github.com/jrfep/jrfep.github.io/tree/jekyll) uses Jekyll (but I gave up on that some time ago, so do not expect any updates).\n\nI [also tried](https://github.com/jrfep/jrfep.github.io/tree/mrhyde) Rmarkdown for some time, might get back to that if this one does not work. \n\nI was tempted to create a multi-lingual site using [babelquarto](https://github.com/ropensci-review-tools/babelquarto):\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages('babelquarto', repos = c('https://ropensci.r-universe.dev', 'https://cloud.r-project.org'))\n```\n:::\n\n\nBut it was a short-lived experiment. I think it could work for simple sites, but would require more tweaks to make it work with my current site. \n\n## Font Awesome\n\nThey work well out of the box with Rmarkdown, but for quarto we need to install an extension.\n\nSwitch to the repository folder and checkout the git branch we are working on, and then:\n\n```sh\nquarto install extension quarto-ext/fontawesome\n```\n\nNow I can use `{{{< fa smile >}}}` in the text and get a {{< fa smile >}}, or `{{{< fa lemon >}}}` and get a {{< fa lemon >}}.\n\n## Just in case\n\n![ [Stand back, I know regular expressions.](https://xkcd.com/208/)](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/regular_expressions.png)\n\n\n[^1]: Yes, I use this [weird spelling...](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/230494/should-i-always-use-the-ised-ending-for-uk-english-and-the-ized-for-us)\n\n## Prepare data for some pages\n\n### OSF data\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhere::i_am(\"how2/how-to-site.qmd\")\nif (!require(osfr)) {\n  install.packages(\"osfr\")\n  library(osfr)\n}\nlst_osf <- osf_retrieve_user(\"me\") %>%\n  osf_ls_nodes()\nif (!dir.exists(here::here(\"data\")))\n    dir.create(here::here(\"data\"))\nfile_name <- here::here(\"data\",\"OSF-data.rds\")\nsaveRDS(file=file_name, lst_osf)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n### GitHub data\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhere::i_am(\"how2/how-to-site.qmd\")\nif (!require(jsonlite)) {\n  install.packages(\"jsonlite\")\n  library(jsonlite)\n}\ngh_rle_org <- read_json(\"https://api.github.com/orgs/red-list-ecosystem/repos\")\ngh_ces_org <- read_json(\"https://api.github.com/orgs/ces-unsw-edu-au/repos\")\ngh_jrfep <- read_json(\"https://api.github.com/users/jrfep/repos\")\n# https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=user:jrfep&fork:false\n# for each repo query the languages_url and summarise the lines of code for each language\nfile_name <- here::here(\"data\",\"GitHub-data.rda\")\nsave(file=file_name, gh_rle_org, gh_ces_org, gh_jrfep)\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Flexdashboard and iNaturalist\n\nI use to have a dashboard here, but it works better with Rmarkdown than with quarto. SO I moved it to another site/repo.\n\nThere might be some alternatives in quarto for this, but haven't tested them yet.\n\nThat OLD dashboard was inspired by this example:\nhttps://github.com/gonzalobravoargentina/inat_flexdashboard_ARG\n\nTo get the data I first install the `rinat` package:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhere::i_am(\"README.Rmd\")\nif (!require(rinat)) {\n  install.packages(\"rinat\")\n  library(rinat)\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nThen I can download the observations from iNaturalist and save them in a data folder:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Download observations and save to RDS file\nuser_obs <- get_inat_obs_user(\"NeoMapas\",maxresults = 5000)\nif (!dir.exists(here::here(\"data\")))\n    dir.create(here::here(\"data\"))\nfile_name <- here::here(\"data\",\"iNaturalist-obs-NeoMapas.rds\")\nsaveRDS(file=file_name, user_obs)\n```\n:::\n\n\nTo get the logo\n\nWith `wget` and ImageMagick, it is easy to download and resize in the terminal (`bash`) with two lines of code:\n\n```sh\n##mkdir \nwget https://neomapas.github.io/assets/images/logo_NeoMapas_p.gif\nmagick logo_NeoMapas_p.gif  -resize 100x148  resize_logo.gif\n```\n\n",
