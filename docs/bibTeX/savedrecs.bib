Abstract = {Pressures are mounting for the adoption of a Global Biodiversity
   Framework that transforms conservation and sustainable use efforts
   worldwide. Underlying this challenge is the biodiversity paradox:
   biological diversity predominantly concentrates in the tropics, while
   human, institutional, and financial resources are primarily located at
   higher latitudes both north and south. Addressing the biodiversity
   paradox requires the expansion and mobilization of human, institutional
   and financial resources around the world. We outline a model championed
   by the IUCN Species Survival Commission (SSC) that builds on the Species
   Conservation Cycle (Assess-Plan-Act-Network-Communicate) and recognizes
   that most conservation action occurs at the national or local level.
   Various strategies are applied to this end by the partners of Reverse
   the Red, a global movement that ignites strategic cooperation and
   science-based action to ensure the survival of wild species and
   ecosystems. The SSC contributes to Reverse the Red through two primary
   strategies: National Species Specialist Groups and Centers for Species
   Survival. By building on existing expert networks and catalyzing efforts
   with established local institutions, we aim to significantly expand
   capacity to implement conservation action at the national level and
   reverse the negative trends indicated by the IUCN Red List of Threatened
   Species and the Red List of Ecosystems.},

Title = {When good attitudes are not enough: understanding intentions to keep

Journal = {ORYX},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {56},
Number = {2},
Pages = {209-217},

Abstract = {Unsustainable harvesting to supply the demand for pets is the second
   most significant threat to parrots (Psittacidae). Given that parrot
   keeping is widespread, in-depth and culturally sensitive research is
   needed to inform and develop interventions targeted at changing consumer
   preferences and purchasing behaviours. Parrot keeping is thought to be
   driven mainly by a desire for companionship (the affection hypothesis).
   Alternative hypotheses include a deeply ingrained culture of parrot
   ownership (the tradition hypothesis) or the influence of socio-economic
   context (the contextual hypothesis). We used the theory of planned
   behaviour to evaluate the relative importance of behavioural and
   contextual factors influencing the intention to keep the
   yellow-shouldered Amazon Amazona barbadensis as a pet. We interviewed
   150 owners and non-owners of parrots in two locations in Macanao
   Peninsula, Margarita Island, Venezuela, where the primary population of
   this species is located. We found mixed evidence supporting both the
   affection and contextual hypotheses: intention to keep parrots was
   higher in non-owners with high education level, strong affective
   attitudes regarding human-animal relationships, and higher expectations
   about social norms (41\% of explained variance). Our study expands
   previous research on the illegal parrot trade by taking into account
   behavioural measures beyond attitudes, highlighting the role of social
   norms frequently ignored in such research. We discuss how a behaviour
   change campaign could redirect affective attitudes in the human-parrot
   relationship, and promote new social norms that support parrot
   conservation. Future research should consider the inclusion of moral and
   injunctive norms, and monitoring of intervention effectiveness.},

Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {We provide an overview of the use of species distribution modeling to
   address research questions related to parrot ecology and conservation at
   a global scale. We conducted a literature search and applied filters to
   select the 82 most relevant studies to discuss. The study of parrot
   species distribution has increased steadily in the past 30 years, with
   methods and computing development maturing and facilitating their
   application for a wide range of research and applied questions.
   Conservation topics was the most popular topic (37\%), followed by
   ecology (34\%) and invasion ecology (20\%). The role of abiotic factors
   explaining parrot distribution is the most frequent ecological
   application. The high prevalence of studies supporting on-ground
   conservation problems is a remarkable example of reduction in the
   research-action gap. Prediction of invasion risk and assessment of
   invasion effect were more prevalent than examples evaluating the
   environmental or economic impact of these invasions. The integration of
   species distribution models with other tools in the decision-making
   process and other data (e.g., landscape metrics, genetic, behavior)
   could even further expand the range of applications and provide a more
   nuanced understanding of how parrot species are responding to their even
   more changing landscape and threats.},

Title = {Shifting cultivation and hunting across the savanna-forest mosaic in the
   Gran Sabana, Venezuela: facing changes},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {JUN 17},
Abstract = {Background. Human encroachment and overexploitation of natural resources
   in the Neotropics is constantly increasing. Indigenous communities all
   across the Amazon, are trapped between a population rise and a hot
   debate about the sustainability of hunting rates. The Garden Hunting
   hypothesis states that shifting cultivation schemes (conucos) used by
   Amazon indigenous communities may generate favorable conditions,
   increasing abundance of small and medium wildlife species close to the
   `gardens' providing game for indigenous hunters.
   Methods. Here, we combined camera trap surveys and spatially explicit
   interview dataset on Pemon indigenous hunting scope and occurrence in a
   mosaic of savanna and forest in the Gran Sabana, Venezuela to evaluate
   to what extent the wildlife resource use corresponds to Garden Hunting
   hypothesis. We applied the Royle-Nichols model and binomial regression
   in order to: (1) assess whether abundance of small and medium wildlife
   species is higher close to conucos and (2) evaluate whether hunters
   select hunting localities based on accessibility to wildlife resources
   (closeness to conuco) more than wildlife abundance.
   Results. We find mixed evidence supporting the Garden Hunting hypothesis
   predictions. Abundance of small and medium species was high close to
   conucos but the pattern was not statistically significant for most of
   them. Perkin seem to hunt in locations dominated by forest, where
   species abundance was predicted to be higher, than in close vicinity to
   conucos. Hunting scope was focused on the most abundant species located
   close to the conuco (Cuniculus paca), but also in less abundant and
   unavailable species (Crax alector, Tapirus terrestris and Odocoileus
   virginianus).
   Conclusions. Our research provided the first attempt of a systematic
   sampling survey in the Gran Sabana, generating a quantitative dataset
   that not only describes the current pattern of wildlife abundance, but
   sets the base-line to monitor temporal and spatial change in this region
   of highland Amazon. We discuss the applicability of the estimates
   generated as a baseline as well as, environmental challenges imposed by
   economic, social and cultural changes such as mining encroachment for
   wildlife management.},

Title = {A Literature Synthesis of Actions to Tackle Illegal Parrot Trade},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The order Psittaciformes is one of the most prevalent groups in the
   illegal wildlife trade. Efforts to understand this threat have focused
   on describing the elements of the trade itself: actors, extraction
   rates, and routes. However, the development of policy-oriented
   interventions also requires an understanding of how research aims and
   actions are distributed across the trade chain, regions, and species. We
   used an action-based approach to review documents published on illegal
   Psittaciformes trade at a global scale to analyze patterns in research
   aims and actions. Research increased exponentially in recent decades,
   recording 165 species from 46 genera, with an over representation of
   American and Australasian genera. Most of the research provided basic
   knowledge for the intermediary side of the trade chain. Aims such as the
   identification of network actors, zoonosis control, and aiding physical
   detection had numerous but scarcely cited documents (low growth rate),
   while behavior change had the highest growth rate. The Americas had the
   highest diversity of research aims, contributing with basic knowledge,
   implementation, and monitoring across the whole trade chain. Better
   understanding of the supply side dynamics in local markets, actor
   typology, and actor interactions are needed. Protecting areas,
   livelihood incentives, and legal substitutes are actions under-explored
   in parrots, while behavior change is emerging.},

Title = {Making inferences about non-detection observations to improve occurrence

Abstract = {The global decline in psittacid populations highlights the need for
   monitoring programmes that allow us to estimate the level of confidence
   that can be placed in a non-detection observation in order to assess
   changes in range status. We used the detection/non-detection records for
   26 psittacid species detected during the first national bird monitoring
   programme in Venezuela carried out in 2010 by the Neotropical
   Biodiversity Mapping Initiative. We fitted occupancy models and evaluate
   the suitability of the data to explain the lack of detections given the
   current sampling effort, and the expected occurrence probabilities due
   to environmental conditions (conditional probability of occurrence;
   psi(CONDL)). We were able to fit reliable models for 13 of the 26
   species detected. For Green-rumped ParrotletForpus passerinus,
   Blue-headed ParrotPionus menstrus, and Orange-winged AmazonAmazona
   amazonica, the probability of detection (p) under the current sampling
   effort was too low (> 0.2) in areas where environmental conditions would
   imply high psi(CONDL)(< 0.3). This suggests that sampling effort should
   be increased to generate reliable estimations of occurrence. In
   contrast, for Scarlet MacawAra macao, Yellow-crowned AmazonAmazona
   ochrocephala, Orange-chinned ParakeetBrotogeris jugularisand
   Brown-throated ParakeetEupsittula pertinaxthe model estimated highp(<
   0.3) and low psi(CONDL)(> 0.2), suggesting that the species are reliably
   detected and better models could be obtained by including other
   predictive variables related to temporal use of resources and habitat
   heterogeneity. To improve the effectiveness of parrot monitoring
   programme in Neotropical countries, we suggest increasing the sampling
   effort, developing several surveys per year, and including variables
   related with temporal use of resources and habitat heterogeneity.},

Abstract = {The perceptions and attitudes of local communities help understand the
   social drivers of unsustainable wildlife use and the social
   acceptability of conservation programs. We evaluated the social context
   influencing illegal harvesting of the threatened yellow-shouldered
   Amazon (Amazona barbadensis) and the effectiveness of a longstanding
   conservation program in the Macanao Peninsula, Margarita Island,
   Venezuela. We interviewed 496 people from three communities and
   documented their perceptions about (1) status and the impact of threats
   to parrot populations, (2) acceptability of the conservation program,
   and (3) social processes influencing unsustainable parrot use. Approval
   of the program was high, but it failed to engage communities despite
   their high conservation awareness and positive attitudes towards the
   species. People identified unsustainable use as the main threat to
   parrots, but negative perceptions were limited to selling, not
   harvesting or keeping. Harvesters with different motivations (keepers,
   sellers) may occur in Macanao, and social acceptability of both actors
   may differ. Future efforts will require a stakeholder engagement
   strategy to manage conflicts and incentives to participation. A better
   understanding of different categories of harvesters, as well as their
   motives and role in the illegal trade network would provide insights to
   the design of a behavior change campaign.},

Title = {Illegal trade of the Psittacidae in Venezuela},
Journal = {ORYX},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {54},
Number = {1},
Pages = {77-83},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Illegal wildlife trade is one of the major threats to Neotropical
   psittacids, with nearly 28\% of species targeted for the illegal pet
   trade. We analysed the most comprehensive data set on illegal wildlife
   trade currently available for Venezuela, from various sources, to
   provide a quantitative assessment of the magnitude, scope and
   detectability of the trade in psittacids at the national level. We
   calculated a specific offer index (SO) based on the frequency of which
   each species was offered for sale. Forty-seven species of psittacids
   were traded in Venezuela during 1981-2015, of which 17 were non-native.
   At least 641,675 individuals were traded, with an overall extraction
   rate of 18,334 individuals per year (35 years of accumulated reports).
   Amazona ochrocephala was the most frequently detected species (SO =
   3.603), with the highest extraction rate (10,544 individuals per year),
   followed by Eupsittula pertinax (SO = 1.357) and Amazona amazonica (SO =
   1.073). Amazona barbadensis, Ara ararauna and Ara chloropterus were the
   fourth most frequently detected species (SO = 0.564-0.615). Eleven
   species were involved principally in domestic trade (> 60\% of records).
   Our approach could be the first step in developing a national monitoring
   programme to inform national policy on the trade in psittacids. Patterns
   and numbers provided may be used to update the official list of
   threatened species, and could also be used in planning conservation
   actions.},

Abstract = {Unsustainable harvest is one of the most important threats to
   biodiversity, and birds are highly impacted, but avian markets remain
   poorly understood. When species value and corruption/criminality are
   high, the ``parallel trafficking{''} hypothesis predicts that illegal
   animal items will move through networks used for other illicit products.
   Alternatively, when particular demands, logistical skills or access
   limits trade, ``specialized trafficking{''} hypotheses predict that few,
   expert actors will control markets. Here, we use social network analysis
   of trade in an Endangered songbird, the Red Siskin Spinus cucullatus,
   originating in Venezuela, to examine the generality of the parallel
   trafficking hypothesis in a setting where corruption/criminality and
   species value are high. In spite of these circumstances, of 2575 Red
   Siskin (RS) records compiled from 2010 to 2017, we found just six
   reports consistent with parallel trafficking. Instead, we discovered an
   independent network of 15 actor types, and a trade structure consistent
   with specialized trafficking. Just two intermediary types (national
   vendors to intermediaries and to consumers) and one consumer type
   (national breeders) had the highest exposure to the flow of birds, and
   the most trade connectivity. Use of wild-caught over captive-bred birds
   was high (67\% of records), as was use of natural-phenotype birds over
   hybrid or mutant-phenotype birds (65\% of records). Geographically,
   Spain and Venezuela had the highest exposure to the flow of birds, but
   Brazil and Colombia had the most direct connections with other
   countries. The unexpected lack of evidence for parallel trafficking
   suggests that combined flows of illicit products are not inevitable,
   even in adverse settings. In a context where law enforcement may not be
   feasible, our results suggest that it may be possible to reduce
   unsustainable harvest using breeder connectivity in informational
   campaigns to stimulate peer-to-peer interactions and accelerate behavior
   change.},

Abstract = {Species distribution models (SDM) can be valuable for identifying key
   habitats for conservation management of threatened taxa, but
   anthropogenic habitat change can undermine SDM accuracy. We used data
   for the Red Siskin (Spinus cucullatus), a critically endangered bird and
   ground truthing to examine anthropogenic habitat change as a source of
   SDM inaccuracy. We aimed to estimate: (1) the Red Siskin's historic
   distribution in Venezuela; (2) the portion of this historic distribution
   lost to vegetation degradation; and (3) the location of key habitats or
   areas with both, a high probability of historic occurrence and a low
   probability of vegetation degradation. We ground-truthed 191 locations
   and used expert opinion as well as landscape characteristics to classify
   species' habitat suitability as excellent, good, acceptable, or poor. We
   fit a Random Forest model (RF) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) time
   series to evaluate the accuracy and precision of the expert
   categorization of habitat suitability. We estimated the probability of
   historic occurrence by fitting a MaxLike model using 88 presence records
   (1960-2013) and data on forest cover and aridity index. Of the entire
   study area, 23\% (20,696km(2)) had a historic probability of Red Siskin
   occurrence over 0.743. Furthermore, 85\% of ground-truthed locations had
   substantial reductions in mean EVI, resulting in key habitats totaling
   just 976km(2), in small blocks in the western and central regions.
   Decline in Area of Occupancy over 15years was between 40\% and 95\%,
   corresponding to an extinction risk category between Vulnerable and
   Critically Endangered. Relating key habitats with other landscape
   features revealed significant risks and opportunities for proposed
   conservation interventions, including the fact that ongoing vegetation
   degradation could limit the establishment of reintroduced populations in
   eastern areas, while the conservation of remaining key habitats on
   private lands could be improved with biodiversity-friendly agri- and
   silviculture programs.},

Abstract = {Retaliatory killing of large carnivores in response to their attacks on
   cattle is recognised as one of the most important factors causing
   worldwide declines of large carnivores. Conversely, hunting is believed
   to have been largely eliminated due to national and international
   protection measures. We studied the prevalence of human jaguar conflict
   and the relative importance of retaliatory killing and hunting for
   jaguar populations in Venezuela by means of field interviews with
   hunters and ranchers. To predict the spatial distribution of retaliatory
   killing or hunting we fit a linear regression model. We registered 387
   jaguar attacks on livestock and 22 attacks on humans.
   Subsistence/commercial hunting appeared the most common cause of
   human-caused jaguar mortality (52\%) and retaliatory killing was less
   common (38\%). Jaguars were also killed because of public fear, attacks
   on pets, by trophy hunters, and in car accidents. Public motivations to
   kill jaguars did not change through time, suggesting that the protection
   system introduced in 1996 has not been effective. Methods and tools used
   in retaliatory killing were different, more sophisticated, and probably
   more efficient than those used in hunting. However, products collected
   from harvested jaguars did not differ between motivation groups and
   included skins, canines, skulls, meat, fat, and cubs. Our model
   indicated that subsistence/commercial hunting is prevalent over most of
   the areas still inhabited by jaguars. On the contrary, retaliatory
   killing was mostly predicted for the areas where jaguars have already
   gone extinct, suggesting that it is an important driving factor of
   jaguar extirpations.},

Title = {Predicting carnivore distribution and extirpation rate based on human

Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {206},

Abstract = {The worldwide decline in carnivore populations has been attributed to
   various human impacts. However, our understanding of the mechanisms
   behind these declines is insufficient to predict the timing and location
   of local extinctions. We collected data on presence/absence and time
   since extirpation of jaguars across Venezuela. To test if human impacts
   or ecosystem productivity better explain the observed spatial variation
   in probability of jaguar occurrence we compared logistic regression
   models fit with different combinations of anthropogenic and
   environmental variables. Similarly, we modelled the time since
   extirpation, using a multiple regression approach. Our study supported
   the hypothesis that jaguar extirpations and distribution are determined
   by a joint effect of anthropogenic factors and environmental variables,
   mainly those related with ecosystem productivity. Human population
   density and habitat alterations exerted strong negative effects on
   jaguar populations, while annual precipitation, mean temperature, forest
   cover, primary productivity, and other vegetation indices had positive
   effects. The strength of human impact is shaped by ecosystem
   productivity: jaguars disappear faster in dry, unproductive areas, and
   survive better in humid, productive areas even when human densities are
   higher. We estimated that jaguars in Venezuela have been extirpated from
   approximately 26\% of the territory of Venezuela; present jaguar range
   covers approximately 66\% of the country. We demonstrate that human
   population density alone cannot adequately explain past extirpations nor
   predict future jaguar declines. We conclude that the predicted future
   growth of the human population will not necessarily determine jaguar
   declines, and proper management and conservation programs could
   potentially prevent jaguar extirpations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Using spatial patterns in illegal wildlife uses to reveal connections

Journal = {CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},

Volume = {30},

Abstract = {Although most often considered independently, subsistence hunting,
   domestic trade, and international trade as components of illegal
   wildlife use (IWU) may be spatially correlated. Understanding how and
   where subsistence and commercial uses may co-occur has important
   implications for the design and implementation of effective conservation
   actions. We analyzed patterns in the joint geographical distribution of
   illegal commercial and subsistence use of multiple wildlife species in
   Venezuela and evaluated whether available data were sufficient to
   provide accurate estimates of the magnitude, scope, and detectability of
   IWU. We compiled records of illegal subsistence hunting and trade from
   several sources and fitted a random-forest classification model to
   predict the spatial distribution of IWUs. From 1969 to 2014, 404 species
   and 8,340,921 specimens were involved in IWU, for a mean extraction rate
   of 185,354 individuals/year. Birds were the most speciose group involved
   (248 spp.), but reptiles had the highest extraction rates (126,414
   individuals/year vs. 3,133 individuals/year for birds). Eighty-eight
   percent of international trade records spatially overlapped with
   domestic trade, especially in the north and along the coast but also in
   western inland areas. The distribution of domestic trade was broadly
   distributed along roads, suggesting that domestic trade does not depend
   on large markets in cities. Seventeen percent of domestic trade records
   overlapped with subsistence hunting, but the spatial distribution of
   this overlap covered a much larger area than between commercial uses.
   Domestic trade seems to respond to demand from rural more than urban
   communities. Our approach will be useful for understanding how IWU works
   at national scales in other parts of the world.},

Title = {Combining threat and occurrence models to predict potential ecological
   traps for Andean bears in the Cordillera de Merida, Venezuela},
Journal = {ANIMAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {17},
Number = {4},
Pages = {388-398},

Abstract = {Ecological traps occur when rapid environmental change makes organisms'
   habitat selection cues misleading and leads them to prefer poor quality
   habitats. Such traps can threaten the persistence of affected
   populations, so techniques to predict and map potential traps are of
   great conservation interest. Here we present a novel method for
   visualizing such traps and their uncertainty at large scales in a
   natural landscape, by combining a spatially explicit model of
   anthropogenic threats with one of occurrence probability. We began with
   poaching and occurrence data for Andean bears in the Cordillera de
   Merida, Venezuela, and applied a partitioning procedure to generate 10
   replicates of three partially independent data subsets. To the first
   subset, we fit a previously developed model of poaching probability,
   while we used the second and third subsets to fit, validate and select
   the best of four occurrence probability models. We then combined
   replicates of the poaching probability model with those of the best
   occurrence probability model to predict the spatial distribution and
   uncertainty of potential ecological traps. The best occurrence model
   predicted high probabilities in the center and in the northern parts of
   Cordillera de Merida, with variation among replicates in the same areas.
   Predicted areas of occurrence covered 10 217 +/- 2762 km(2) (24\%) of
   the study area. However, more than a third of this area had a high
   probability of being an ecological trap. Furthermore, these potential
   ecological traps were next to or within the largest national parks and
   were surrounded by large areas with high occurrence probability and low
   poaching probability. Future research should focus on independent
   verification of potential occupancy and ecological traps, as well as on
   bear dispersal behavior. In areas where ecological traps are confirmed,
   targeted education and law enforcement will be most effective, while in
   confirmed safe harbor areas, increasing connectivity will be equally
   important. Our approach will be useful to identify potential ecological
   traps at the landscape level created by hunting and other human
   activities elsewhere in the world.},

Title = {Using limited data to detect changes in species distributions: Insights
   from Amazon parrots in Venezuela},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {173},
Pages = {133-143},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Documenting changes in distribution is necessary for understanding
   species' response to environmental changes, but data on species
   distributions are heterogeneous in accuracy and resolution. Combining
   different data sources and methodological approaches can fill gaps in
   knowledge about the dynamic processes driving changes in species-rich,
   but data-poor regions. We combined recent bird survey data from the
   Neotropical Biodiversity Mapping Initiative (NeoMaps) with historical
   distribution records to estimate potential changes in the distribution
   of eight species of Amazon parrots in Venezuela. Using environmental
   covariates and presence-only data from museum collections and the
   literature, we first used maximum likelihood to fit a species
   distribution model (SDM) estimating a historical maximum probability of
   occurrence for each species. We then used recent, NeoMaps survey data to
   build single-season occupancy models (OM) with the same environmental
   covariates, as well as with time- and effort-dependent detectability,
   resulting in estimates of the current probability of occurrence. We
   finally calculated the disagreement between predictions as a matrix of
   probability of change in the state of occurrence. Our results suggested
   negative changes for the only restricted, threatened species, Amazona
   barbadensis, which has been independently confirmed with field studies.
   Two of the three remaining widespread species that were detected,
   Amazona amazonica, Amazona ochrocephala, also had a high probability of
   negative changes in northern Venezuela, but results were not conclusive
   for Amazona farinosa. The four remaining species were undetected in
   recent field surveys; three of these were most probably absent from the
   survey locations (Amazona autumnalis, Amazona mercenaria and Amazona
   festiva), while a fourth (Amazona dufresniana) requires more intensive
   targeted sampling to estimate its current status. Our approach is unique
   in taking full advantage of available, but limited data, and in
   detecting a high probability of change even for rare and
   patchily-distributed species. However, it is presently limited to
   species meeting the strong assumptions required for maximum-likelihood
   estimation with presence-only data, including very high detectability
   and representative sampling of its historical distribution. (C) 2013

Title = {Congruence and Diversity of Butterfly-Host Plant Associations at Higher
   Taxonomic Levels},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {8},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY 23},
Abstract = {We aggregated data on butterfly-host plant associations from existing
   sources in order to address the following questions: (1) is there a
   general correlation between host diversity and butterfly species
   richness?, (2) has the evolution of host plant use followed consistent
   patterns across butterfly lineages?, (3) what is the common ancestral
   host plant for all butterfly lineages? The compilation included 44,148
   records from 5,152 butterfly species (28.6\% of worldwide species of
   Papilionoidea) and 1,193 genera (66.3\%). The overwhelming majority of
   butterflies use angiosperms as host plants. Fabales is used by most
   species (1,007 spp.) from all seven butterfly families and most
   subfamilies, Poales is the second most frequently used order, but is
   mostly restricted to two species-rich subfamilies: Hesperiinae (56.5\%
   of all Hesperiidae), and Satyrinae (42.6\% of all Nymphalidae). We found
   a significant and strong correlation between host plant diversity and
   butterfly species richness. A global test for congruence (Parafit test)
   was sensitive to uncertainty in the butterfly cladogram, and suggests a
   mixed system with congruent associations between Papilionidae and
   magnoliids, Hesperiidae and monocots, and the remaining subfamilies with
   the eudicots (fabids and malvids), but also numerous random
   associations. The congruent associations are also recovered as the most
   probable ancestral states in each node using maximum likelihood methods.
   The shift from basal groups to eudicots appears to be more likely than
   the other way around, with the only exception being a Satyrine-clade
   within the Nymphalidae that feed on monocots. Our analysis contributes
   to the visualization of the complex pattern of interactions at
   superfamily level and provides a context to discuss the timing of
   changes in host plant utilization that might have promoted
   diversification in some butterfly lineages.},

Journal = {REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {61},

Abstract = {The development of efficient sampling protocols is an essential
   prerequisite to evaluate and identify priority conservation areas. There
   are few protocols for fauna inventory and monitoring in wide
   geographical scales for the tropics, where the complexity of communities
   and high biodiversity levels, make the implementation of efficient
   protocols more difficult. We proposed here a simple strategy to optimize
   the capture of dung beetles, applied to sampling with baited traps and
   generalizable to other sampling methods. We analyzed data from eight
   transects sampled between 2006-2008 with the aim to develop an uniform
   sampling design, that allows to confidently estimate species richness,
   abundance and composition at wide geographical scales. We examined four
   characteristics of any sampling design that affect the effectiveness of
   the sampling effort: the number of traps, sampling duration, type and
   proportion of bait, and spatial arrangement of the traps along
   transects. We used species accumulation curves, rank-abundance plots,
   indicator species analysis, and multivariate correlograms. We captured
   40 337 individuals (115 species/morphospecies of 23 genera). Most
   species were attracted by both dung and carrion, but two thirds had
   greater relative abundance in traps baited with human dung. Different
   aspects of the sampling design influenced each diversity attribute in
   different ways. To obtain reliable richness estimates, the number of
   traps was the most important aspect. Accurate abundance estimates were
   obtained when the sampling period was increased, while the spatial
   arrangement of traps was determinant to capture the species composition
   pattern. An optimum sampling strategy for accurate estimates of
   richness, abundance and diversity should: (1) set 50-70 traps to
   maximize the number of species detected, (2) get samples during 48-72
   hours and set trap groups along the transect to reliably estimate
   species abundance, (3) set traps in groups of at least 10 traps to
   suitably record the local species composition, and (4) separate trap
   groups by a distance greater than 5-10km to avoid spatial
   autocorrelation. For the evaluation of other sampling protocols we
   recommend to, first, identify the elements of sampling design that could
   affect the sampled effort (the number of traps, sampling duration, type
   and proportion of bait) and their spatial distribution (spatial
   arrangement of the traps) and then, to evaluate how they affect
   richness, abundance and species composition estimates.},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Aim To test a method for rapidly and reliably collecting species
   distribution and abundance data over large tropical areas {[}known as
   Neotropical Biodiversity Mapping Initiative (NeoMaps)], explicitly
   seeking to improve cost- and time-efficiencies over existing methods
   (i.e. museum collections, literature), while strengthening local
   capacity for data collection. Location Venezuela. Methods We placed a
   grid over Venezuela (0.5 x 0.5 degree cells) and applied a stratified
   sampling design to select a minimum set of 25 cells spanning
   environmental and biogeographical variation. We implemented standardized
   field sampling protocols for birds, butterflies and dung beetles, along
   transects on environmental gradients (gradsects). We compared species
   richness estimates from our field surveys at national, bioregional and
   cell scales to those calculated from data compiled from museum
   collections and the literature. We estimated the variance in richness,
   composition, relative abundance and diversity between gradsects that
   could be explained by environmental and biogeographical variables. We
   also estimated total survey effort and cost. Results In one field
   season, we covered 8\% of the country and recorded 66\% of all known
   Venezuelan dung beetles, 52\% of Pierid butterflies and 37\% of birds.
   Environmental variables explained 2760\% of variation in richness for
   all groups and 1343\% of variation in abundance and diversity in dung
   beetles and birds. Bioregional and environmental variables explained
   4358\% of the variation in the dissimilarity matrix between transects
   for all groups. Main conclusions NeoMaps provides reliable estimates of
   richness, composition and relative abundance, required for rigorous
   monitoring and spatial prediction. NeoMaps requires a substantial
   investment, but is highly efficient, achieving survey goals for each
   group with 1-month fieldwork and about US\$ 18 per km2. Future work
   should focus on other advantages of this type of survey, including the
   ability to monitor the changes in relative abundance and turnover in
   species composition, and thus overall diversity patterns.},

Abstract = {We developed a field survey protocol based on the North American
   Breeding Bird Survey to evaluate the efficiency and reliability of a
   bird monitoring scheme in the Neotropics, known as NeoMaps. A team of 21
   amateur and professional ornithologists conducted bird counts at 27
   locations distributed throughout Venezuela between March and April 2010.
   Locations selected followed a stratified spatial sampling design derived
   from environmental and biogeographical variables. Two complementary
   survey protocols were implemented in consecutive days along 40-km-long
   roadside transects. Three-minute point counts were performed at 50
   stops, 800 m from each other on day I. Cumulative species lists were
   recorded at a selection of 10 stops sampled for 9 min each, divided into
   three consecutive 3-min periods on day 2. We recorded 593 species at the
   27 sites combined, representing 57\% of the 1,033 potential species, or
   43\% of all known Venezuelan species. An additional 83 species were
   recorded outside of the formal point counts, for a total of 676 species
   detected. Groups such as hummingbirds and most waterbirds had unusually
   low numbers of both species and individuals, probably due to an
   abnormally dry year. Our survey methods appear to be appropriate for
   surveying most common diurnal non-colonial species. This is the first
   large-scale, systematic bird survey in Venezuela or, to our knowledge,
   in any other tropical country. Received 13 March 2011. Accepted 20

Title = {Factors affecting poaching risk to Vulnerable Andean bears Tremarctos

Abstract = {Worldwide, many, large mammals are threatened by poaching. However,
   understanding the causes of poaching is difficult when both hunter and
   hunted are elusive. One alternative is to apply regression models to
   opportunistically-collected data but doing so without accounting for
   inherent biases may result in misleading conclusions. To demonstrate a
   straightforward method to account for Such biases, and to guide further
   research on an elusive Vulnerable species, we visualized spatio-temporal
   poaching patterns in 844 Andean bear Tremarctos ornatus presence reports
   from the Cordillera de Merida, Venezuela. To create maps of poaching
   risk we fitted two logistic regression models to a Subset of 287
   precisely georeferenced reports, one ignoring and one including spatial
   autocorrelation. Whereas the variance explained by both model., was low,
   the second had better fit and predictive ability, and indicated that
   protected status had a significant positive effect on reducing poaching
   risk. Poaching risk increased at lower altitudes, where all indicators
   of human disturbance increased, although there was scant evidence that
   human-bear conflicts are a major direct trigger of poaching events.
   Because highest-risk areas Were different from areas with most bear
   report:3, we speculate that hunting may be driven by opportunistic
   encounters, rather than by purposeful searches in high-quality bear
   habitat. Further research comparing risk maps with bear abundance models
   and data on poaching behaviour will be invaluable for clarifying
   poaching causes and for identifying management strategies.},

Title = {Population management of threatened taxa in captivity within their
   natural ranges: Lessons from Andean bears (Tremarctos ornatus) in
   Venezuela},

Abstract = {Populations of threatened taxa in captivity within their natural ranges
   can make important contributions to conservation, but these may be
   compromised by the inappropriate application of population management
   goals developed in other contexts. We conducted demographic, genetic,
   and population viability analyses on the captive population of Andean
   bears (Tremarctos ornatus) in Venezuela to investigate the management of
   within-range captive populations in general, and to better integrate
   this population into the conservation of Andean bears in particular. We
   found that although the present population is very small and not
   internally self-sustaining, incorporation of confiscated wild
   individuals has resulted in a low average number of generations in
   captivity and low inbreeding, with moderate gene diversity and a high
   probability of future population persistence. However, past imports from
   extra-range populations have been from over-represented lineages of
   unknown origin, which have mixed with under-represented Venezuelan ones,
   reducing the future value of the Venezuelan population as a source for
   founder stock. Our analyses indicate that the rate of incorporation of
   wild recruits is a major factor influencing proxy measures of
   conservation value, and distinguishing within-from extra-range
   populations. This implies that, contrary to conventional wisdom,
   internal self-sustainability can be a misguided goal in within-range
   populations, which furthermore may not be suitable destinations for
   surplus animals from captive populations elsewhere. (c) 2005 Elsevier
